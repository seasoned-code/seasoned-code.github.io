I am an experienced software developer. My career has brought me to a number of organizations from both the public to private markets. For the most part I develop in the .Net framework. I am partial to working with Free and Open Source Software. Which, until recently, meant I dabbled with frameworks that run under Linux. However, with the advent of .Net Core, I have been working pretty exclusively in that arena (while in Linux). I have a few projects that I am currently working on that I am super excited about to share. I am hopeful, in due time, that I will be able to publish my current endeavors!
