I am an experienced software developer. My career has brought me to a number of organizations from both public to private markets. For the most part I developed in the .Net framework (for my employers). I enjoy working with Free and Open Source Software, which, until recently meant I dabbled with frameworks that run under Linux. However, the advent of .Net Core, I have working pretty exclusively in that arena (in Linux). I have a few projects that I am currently working on, which I am not ready to share, but in due time I hope to!
