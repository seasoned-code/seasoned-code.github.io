One of my, many, passions, but one that is worthy to be a first class citizen on this site. Food. I do not claim to be a good cook, but quite possibly a competent one. I dabble here and I dabble there in a variety of recipes. Whether it is from saut√©eing a dish or baking a bread or pizza. I often try out recipes, rarely however, do I follow it to a T. Being a home cook, to me, is an art form rather a science. I am not always too precise on the measurements, I might add a dash of this and a dash of that or sneak in some added nutrition there.

My goal is to prepare a decent meal at least once a week (often on the weekends), and I would like to share with you what I decide to tackle. I hope you do not mind vegetarian meals, because that is what I predominately cook!

Please check back, often!
