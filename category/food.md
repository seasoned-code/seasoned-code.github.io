I enjoy being a home cook. Whether it is from saut√©eing a dish or baking a bread or pizza. I often try out recipes, rarely however, do I follow it to a T. Being a home cook, to me, is more of an art than science. I am not always too precise on the measurements, I might add a dash of this and a dash of that or sneak in some added nutrition.

My goal is to post a recipe at least once a week, so check back if you are interested on seeing some, predominately, vegetarian meals!
