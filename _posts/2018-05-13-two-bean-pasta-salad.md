### Ingredients
* 2 cups macaroni (cooked)
* 1 15oz can black beans (rinsed)
* 1 15oz can red beans (rinsed)
* 1 carrot (finely chopped)
* 3 celery stalks (finely chopped)
* 1 cup frozen peas (thawed)

### Instructions
1. Cook the macaroni, I used quinoa pasta-- it's great! Rinse pasta after draining the water.
2. In a large bowl, add the remaining ingredients and stir.
3. Serve with your preferred dressing. You could choose to use mayo and dill, or you could use a vinaigrette/Italian salad dressing.

### Closing
This is a quick meal in a pinch. I almost always have the ingredients required for it. Also, it's another one of those that work really well on a hot summer day (it was not hot, it was actually rather cool out today :P).

I have seasoned with an assortment of toppings. From olive oil-salt-pepper, mayo-dill, or an Italian dressing. It all depends on what you're looking for.

Do not feel you need to tie yourself to these ingredients, mix and match with something else, try it out!
