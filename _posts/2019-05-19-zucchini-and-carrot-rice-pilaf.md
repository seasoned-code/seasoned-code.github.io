### Ingredients
* 2 cups brown rice (cooked)
* 1/2 zucchini (grated)
* 1 large carrot (grated)
* 2 tablespoon butter
* 1 15oz can red beans (rinsed and drained)
* 1/2 cup vegetable broth
* some salt
* liberal use of fresh crushed pepper
* 1 teaspooon parsley
* 1/2 teaspoon basil

### Instructions
1. Prepare the rice (1 cup dry). You _could_ cook it with the other ingredients, just make sure to add the water/broth needed to cook rice, with an additional 1/2 cup of broth stated in the recipe.
2. In a medium sauce pan, on medium-high, add butter. When warm, add zucchini and carrot. Cook for 3 minutes.
3. Add beans cook for additional minute.
4. Add rice, broth, salt pepper, parsley and basil. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until broth is predominately absorbed.
5. Serve!  

### Inspired by
Followed the 'simple veggie rice,' <a href="https://www.onelovelylife.com/simple-veggie-rice/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I have a rice cooker, so I cooked the rice to my preferred texture and it takes less time cooking brown rice that way. Also, I added beans, because I wanted to make a meal out of this instead of a side dish.

### Closing
I was looking for something new to try out with rice this evening. This one came up, and I realized I had zucchini in the fridge, so I gave it a go. It turned out really nicely. I am low on olive oil so I opted with butter. Honestly, it gave it a much richer flavour and I might make it this way the next time, again. However, if I was to make any modifications, I would likely add some broccoli. I liked the colours going on with this meal.

Not much to say, other than this was pretty quick to whip up on a short notice!
