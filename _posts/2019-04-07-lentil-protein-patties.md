### Ingredients
* 1/2 cup brown rice (cooked)
* 1/2 cup green lentils (dry)
* 1/2 cup red lentils (dry)
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/4 cup TVP (dry)
* 1/4 cup milled chickpeas
* 1/4 cup milled flaxseed
* 1 teaspoon salt
* liberal use of crushed peppercorn
* 1 tablespoon garlic powder
* 1 tablespoon onion powder
* olive oil to grease pan
* _optionally add some cayenne pepper_

### Instructions
1. Cook lentils [red and green together], add a tablespoon of olive oil while cooking. 15-20 minutes into cooking, add dry TVP.
  * If rice is not already prepared, do that too!
2. When lentils/TVP are cooked, remove from heat. Mix in all remaining ingredients into pot, (including additional 2 tablespoons olive oil).
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit.
4. On a jelly roll pan, spread the additional olive oil until it is greased.
5. Using a spoon, scoop out lentil mixture into 8-9 flattened balls on the pan.
6. Bake in oven for 20 minutes, flip each patty then bake for additional 20 minutes.

### Inspired by
The patties were based off this <a href="https://www.foodbymaria.com/2017/03/12/gluten-free-lentil-patties/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. Somethings were changed, particularly with the addition of rice (first time making this I used leftover rice), and olive oil. Also, I did not use bread crumbs to thicken the mixture.

### Closing
This it the "follow-up" post regarding the lentil patties. These go _really_ well with the <a href="/food/2019/04/07/homemade-sandwich-buns.html" target="_blank">homemade sandwich buns</a>. You do not need to add buns, but it's a nice touch. In the past, I have even made spicier versions with some cayenne pepper. Feel free to add other ingredients as well, maybe even a fresh pepper, or fresh garlic and onion!

Welcome the warm months with this more summer meal!
