### OpenSSH

This is big! This is not just the OpenSSH client, this is the _server_, too! For years, you had to add work arounds to get OpenSSH Server installed. Most recently, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux" target="_blank">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> allowed a user to add support through BASH (which is cool in itself!), and before that through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>. However, this is no longer the case, you will be able to install through the feature wizard in Windows. Follow this blog <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2017/12/15/using-the-openssh-beta-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update-and-windows-server-1709/" target="_blank">post</a> from msdn to get the details!

### Closing

I am extremely excited about this for more than one reason. 
1. OpenSSH is a powerful tool, the flexibility for which you can do with it is quite boundless. 
2. My projects that I have been working on, would benefit greatly from this.
- I will add, the time is nigh, and I feel I will be able to showcase it!
