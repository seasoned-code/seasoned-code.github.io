### Ingredients
* 1 loaf <a href="/_posts/2018/03/18/corned-beef-seitan.html">Corned Beef Seitan</a> (prepared separately)
* 1 loaf <a href="/_posts/2018/03/18/soda-bread.html">Soda Bread</a> (prepared separately)
* 6 small-medium potatoes (quartered)
* 4 carrots (into quarters and halved)
* 1/4 green cabbage (peeled and cut in thirds)
* Some salt (if you deem it necessary)

### Instructions
1. Prepare Corned Beef Seitan and Soda Bread.
2. In a large pot on high, fill with water, potatoes, carrots and add some salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20-24 minutes.
3. Within the last 6 minutes add the cabbage, be sure not to over cook.
4. Prepare when vegetables are tender with your corned beef and soda bread.

### Inspired by
Original recipe came from the corned beef <a href="https://jlgoesvegan.com/vegan-corned-beef-recipe/" target="_blank">recipe</a>, but I also added carrots.

### Closing
I decided to make an epic of a meal for St. Patrick's Day, because everyone is Irish on that day, right, right!? Anyway, this was a fun meal to prepare, it was something different and a challenge that I can say I did _not_ pass with flying colours, but that's okay! I would definitely like to give the seitan another go and the soda bread as well.

Enjoy St. Patrick's day, even if this post takes place the day after!
