### Inspired by
Recipe came from the <a href="/food/2018/03/18/st-patricks-day-irish-meal.html" target="_blank">2018 Irish Meal</a>. The patties were based off this <a href="https://www.foodbymaria.com/2017/03/12/gluten-free-lentil-patties/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I will have a follow-up with a non "corned beef" flavour in the future.

### Closing
Here is a follow-up to my attempt last year (post is linked in the inspired by). I disliked the saltiness of the original broth so I toned it way way down (also it's only 1/6th the amount from the original recipe)! I did not use it as a brine either, but instead used it as a broth to be added to the patties and a gravy to enhance the flavour of the meal. I think _this_ is something that I will try to do every year! These patties also inspired me to make other meals, and I will post those in the future, too!

I hope you enjoyed St. Patrick's day, even if this post takes place the follow week!
