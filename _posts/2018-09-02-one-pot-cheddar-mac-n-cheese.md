### Ingredients
* 2 1/2 cups macaroni (dry)
* 2 3/4 cups milk (used whole)
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 1/2 cups cheddar (grated)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* liberal use of crushed peppercorn

### Instructions
1. In a pot, on medium heat, combine all ingredients. Bring to a boil, stirring periodically.
2. Reduce heat to medium low for an additional 10 minutes or until creamy, continue to stir periodically.
3. Serve, ideally with some broccoli, or something!

### Inspiration
Actually came across this recipe on a reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/8t9z8n/homemade_one_pot_mac_cheese/" target="_blank">post</a> a little over a month ago. It took me a while to actually go ahead and make it. In addition, it was all in metric and I had to do some conversions. The heat recommendations were not listed either, so I had to figure that out as well. The original poster also used different cheeses, I stuck with one, it might have something to do with why theirs looks creamier (temperature might have something to do with it as well).

### Closing
This was a quick fix meal. I definitely recommend adding other sides as well, and not just stick to the mac-n-cheese. Broccoli, I find, works really well with mac-n-cheese. So I recommend you add that on the side. I also seasoned some chickpeas on the above image, too.

One other thing, that I do not usually do, is going with a traditional pasta. Usually, I cook with a protein or at the very least whole grain. I did not do that this time. I find that since I cannot rinse the pasta that it would have had a funny taste (I rinse my whole grain and protein pastas because of it). I could always try to making the pasta separate sometime and try it out as a variation.

Give it a go, and let me know if you do anything different!
