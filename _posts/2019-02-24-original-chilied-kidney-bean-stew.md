### Closing
This is an original recipe, with just using what I had in the kitchen. It turned out pretty well, especially on a cold and blustery day! You may choose to add more chili powder, mine is also quite aged and has lost much of its potency. I also find that you do not need to have rice with it, but it adds a nice texture and makes a complete protein with the beans. In addition to the rice, feel free to dip with some tortilla chips!

The beans in my first attempt were not actually canned, but rather frozen after being cooked in its dry form.

Try a bowl!
