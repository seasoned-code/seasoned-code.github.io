### Inspired by
I would like to give some credit where credit is due! I started off with this <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16217/vegan-split-pea-soup-i/">link</a> for inspiration. I made slight variations with the bay leaf and by adding the vegetables sooner with an additional cup of water since I felt it was light in that regard.

### Closing
I love all of the textures in this soup, the barley adds a nice touch. Also another neat facet about this recipe, there is no call for any vegetable broth base as it is very flavourful in its own right. There is enough in this batch that you can store some in the freezer and it keeps very, very well. I have to say, I had some leftover split pea soup last night, which was frozen (then reheated!), it was fantastic!
