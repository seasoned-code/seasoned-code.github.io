### Ingredients
* 4 Red potatoes (thickly sliced and quartered)
* 1 carrot (thickly chopped)
* 1/2 onion (thickly chopped)
* 1 bell pepper (thickly chopped)
* 6 kabob sticks
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* few shakes of garlic powder
* few shakes of dry parsley
* liberal use of ground peppercorn

### Instructions
1. Interchange the vegetables on each kabob.
2. In a small bowl mix the olive oil, garlic powder, parsley, and pepper.
3. Prepare the grill, I used charcoal.
4. When coals are ready, spread the kabobs and cover.
5. Return after 5 minutes and rotate and flip with tongs. Drizzle the olive oil across all kabobs, and cover again.
6. Continue returning 5-7 minutes to rotate and flip. Do this for about 30-40 minutes in total, until vegetables are tender.

### Closing
I had a grill, and being that I generally cook vegetables I had to think of _something_ to do with it! Man-o-man, am I glad I did this. It was a hit, I never cooked kabobs before, nor have I looked up any recipes for it, so I just winged this one. I will be coming back to it, it was just fantastic.

I will likely add more potatoes, those were a hit, and I will try to add some fruit in the mix and try different vegetable as well.

Give this a go, I am sure you will want more!
