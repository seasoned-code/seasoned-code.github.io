### Ingredients
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 2-3 potatoes (diced)
* 1 lb (about 23) fresh Brussels Sprouts (trimmed and halved)
* 2 large carrots (cubed)
* 1/2 red bell pepper (chopped)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* liberal use of crushed pepper corn
* 1/3 cup water
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice

### Instructions
1. In a large skillet/fry pan, heat olive oil on medium-high.  When warm, add potatoes and cook for about 5 minutes.
2. Add Brussels Sprouts, carrots, bell peppers, salt and pepper. Stirring frequently, cook until caramelized (about 8-10 minutes).
3. Add water, while continuing to stir, and cook until water has evaporated (about 2-4 minutes).
4. Place directly into serving bowl and splash with lemon juice.
5. Serve with your main dish!

### Inspiration
I had some homegrown potatoes, and I had Brussels Sprouts, and I really like this <a href="/2018/04/01/lemon-brussels/sprouts-and-carrots.html" target="_blank">recipe</a>, so I added to it!

### Closing
This was a really good addition to the original. To make a full meal, you will want to add a protein on the side (I used beans). I considered adding beans to this recipe, but sided against it. I was afraid it would add a texture I was not looking for. With that said, I think this tasted better than the original (and I make it alllll the time), and there is just so much colour!

Do you add to existing recipes, and if so, do you usually have a good experience when you do so?
