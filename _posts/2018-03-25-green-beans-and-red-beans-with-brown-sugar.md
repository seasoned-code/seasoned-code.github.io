### Ingredients
* 1-2 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 onion (chopped)
* 2 cups frozen green beans
* 1 15 oz can red beans (rinsed)
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* liberal use of crushed pepper corn

### Instructions
1. In a large skillet/fry pan, heat olive oil on medium-high. When warm, sauté onion for about 1 minute.
2. Add green beans and red beans, and continue sautéing for another 3 minutes.
3. Add brown sugar, salt and pepper, continue sautéing for an additional 10-12 minutes (or until beans are all caramelized).
4. Serve directly after.

### Closing
This is another one of those meals that work really well in a pinch. There is not much preparation, and it cooks pretty quickly. My first rendition of this recipe was with fresh green beans from a CSA. I prefer the fresh beans, because they are usually crispier. Either way, this has a sweet and zippy bite, depending on how much pepper you add.

Today, I had this with a salad. I felt they complimented each other quite nicely, I wonder what you would try!?
