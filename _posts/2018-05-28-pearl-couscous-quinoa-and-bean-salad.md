### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 cup pearl couscous (uncooked)
* 1/2 cup quinoa (uncooked)
* 1 15oz can of kidney beans (rinsed)
* 10 leaves fresh basil
* 1/4 cup pine nuts
* 1/4 onion (finely chopped)
* 4 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
* 2 tomatoes (diced)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* liberal use of ground pepper

### Instructions
1. Prepare the couscous and quinoa to your packages' specifications.
2. While couscous and quinoa are cooking, boil another pot of water for the blanching of the basil leaves. When water is boiling add the leaves for about 10 seconds, pour into a colander. Rinse with cold water (while in the colander). Finely chop the basil leaves.
3. 
  * a. In a small pot, on medium, cook pine nuts for about 2 minutes, stir occasionally. Let cool.
  * b. -Optional- If you do not wish to eat raw onion and garlic (they leave a bit of a bite), sauté in olive oil for about 2 minutes on medium high. Let cool.
4. In a large bowl, combine and stir the cooled couscous and quinoa, kidney beans, olive oil, cooled pine nuts, onion, garlic, tomatoes, salt, and pepper.
5. Serve or place in fridge till needed!

### Inspiration
I loosely followed this <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/israeli-couscous-and-tomato-salad-with-arugula-pesto" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I was just looking for a good summer or Memorial Day Weekend meals, and came across it. Needless to say, I did not use all of the same ingredients, and I did use a food processor.

### Closing
I really, really, like this one. It tastes even better if you let it sit in the fridge over night! If you are looking for a good summer meal or side this is a good goto that you would like to bring with you to a picnic!

The original recipe did not use quinoa or beans (funny enough, I did not realize I pulled out kidney until I opened the can, I was intending black beans instead!!), but by doing so you get some really good textures (the couscous already had that amazing texture!) and once again, you called it, you get yourself some good protein!

When I made this recipe, I did not cook the onion or garlic and so it had a rather bit of a bite to it. I think the next time I will sauté them before adding them to the salad and see how it goes.

Have a cooled off meal!
