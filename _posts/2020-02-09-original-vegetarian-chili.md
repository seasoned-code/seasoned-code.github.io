### Closing
I made this recipe on a cold day last week, and I was amazed at how well it turned out. I did not record or take a picture of it, so I had to make it again! Glad I did, because it was good the second time, too! Albeit I added a little less salt the second time around and you may want to add to taste.

It is funny, this tastes and has much of the texture I was looking for with the madras recipe I made a few months back. With the barley the vegetarian dish finishes the circle for the complete protein. The lentils gives some added texture.

This is just another one of those dishes that will not disappoint on a cold day, especially if you add a biscuit to the side!
