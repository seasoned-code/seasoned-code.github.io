### Closing
Another one of those quick and nifty additions when you're looking for some zip to a meal. I do not usually have hot peppers on hand so adding a cayenne pepper makes up for it. Occasionally, I will add some bell pepper.

Feel free to use this for chips or a condiment with tacos or a burrito!
