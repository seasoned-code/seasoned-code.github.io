* Biscuits
  - 4 cups flour
  - 1/8 cup wheat germ
  - 1/4 cup <a href="https://www.betterbodyfoods.com/product/livfit-superfood-organic-superfood-blend/" target="_blank">Organic LIVfit Superfood Blend</a>
  - 2 Tablespoons baking powder
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1 cup butter
  - 1 3/4 cup milk

* 1 cup frozen corn

### Instructions
Mashed Chickpeas
1. In a medium pot, on medium-high, pour the chickpeas w/ liquid, oregano, garlic power, salt and liberal amount of pepper then stir.
2. As liquid boils off, you have the choice of making more of a gravy or a mashed chickpea.
3. Using a potato masher mash the chickpeas until smooth.
4. Turn down the heat to a simmer.

Beans
1. In a fry pan, on medium high, add olive oil.
2. When oil is warm, add onions, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. Add frozen green beans, shake or stir the beans and onions until beans are hot, add salt and pepper to heart's content

Biscuits
1. Preheat oven at 450 degrees fahrenheit
2. Add all dry ingredients together in a bowl. 
3. Add butter and mix (ideally with a stand mixer) until crumbly.
4. Add in the milk and mix until forms into a ball.
5. Roll out onto a floured surface and cut into biscuits.
  - If you want the biscuits to be more flaky/layered when they are baked do not be too critical on the consistency when rolling.
  - You can use a glass to cut the biscuits
6. Bake for 8-12 minutes. 
  - Alternatively, you can flash freeze the remainder on a cookie sheet for 1-2 hours. Place them in an airtight container for future glory.
  - Defrost them in the microwave for 45 seconds to a minute (at full power) before baking.

Corn
1. Microwave the frozen corn or cook on the stove, your choice. Nothing special going on here!

### Inspirations
Making this <a href="http://moneysavingmom.com/2013/02/homemade-freezer-biscuits-recipe.html" target="_blank">biscuit recipe</a> will be a large batch, you will not likely need to make all, so freeze them! Also, I added some nutricious goodness with the LIVfit Superfood and wheatgerm.

### Closing
This meal consisted of a few recipes all at once, but they make a pretty good combination! Originally, I was intending to make a chickpea gravy, but I boiled off a little more liquid than I intended! However, the chickpeas turned out really nicely. With the green beans if you cook them too long they will get soft since they started frozen, so do not cook too long! The biscuits go really, really well with this food combination.

Enjoy!
