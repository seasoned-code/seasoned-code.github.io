A family favourite. This has much of the flavour of a traditional Chicken Pot Pie, but it is vegetarian.

### Ingredients
* 1 cup thinly sliced carrots
* 1 cup frozen green peas
* 1 cup small diced potatoes (if red or gold leave peels)
* 1/2 cup thinly sliced celery
* 3/4 cup water
* 1/3 cup finely chopped onion
* 1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
* 1/3 cup unbleached, all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper (I am a little more liberal on this)
* 1/4 teaspoon parsley flakes
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 3/4 cups vegetable broth
* 2/3 cup milk (whole) 
* 1 15oz can of Great Northern Beans (drained and rinsed)
+ Two 9-inch <a href="/food/2019/12/01/pie-crusts.html" target="_blank">pie crusts</a> (my recipe excluded sugar to maintain a savory flavour)

### Instructions
Note: I found that doing the prep work the night before is really beneficial e.g. (the chopping, combining flour and seasonings, and crust preparation).

1. Prepare pie crusts
2. In a medium sized pot on medium-high, add carrots, potatoes, celery, peas, and water. Cook till vegetables are tender (about 15 minutes). You can decide to drain the water or let it absorb, I favour the latter since draining takes some of the nutrients away.
3. In a large skillet/fry pan, on medium add butter.
4. When butter has melted, add onions, cook till translucent (about 5 minutes).
5. Add flour, salt, pepper, parsley flakes and garlic. Cook for about 2 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit.
7. Slowly add vegetable broth and milk. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook till thickens (about 5 minutes).
8. When sauce is thickened add vegetables and beans.
9. In a deep-round casserolle dish (you can use a pie plate, but I found doing so often had overflow), fit the bottom pie crust. Add the pie filling, then fit the top pie crust. Add a few slits on top. Place in oven for 30-35 minutes.

### Inspired by

This was in majority borrowed from the following <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/trisha-yearwood/chickless-pot-pie-recipe-2119520" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I substituted a few ingredients and added beans (I have used chickpeas in the past but I prefer the former) as a protein.

### Closing

This meal has become a comfort food favourite during the holidays. Its rich flavour is absolutely delicious and it keeps well in the fridge for leftovers. So try (even though it may be hard) not to eat too much in one sitting and it may just last you a few days!
