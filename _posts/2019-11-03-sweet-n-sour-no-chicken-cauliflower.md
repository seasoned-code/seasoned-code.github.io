### Ingredients
#### Vegetables
* 1 cup rice (dry)
* 6 1/2 cups cauliflower florets (fresh, cut with a flat side)
* grease (for pan)

#### Sauce
* 3 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
* 1 tablespoon ginger root (finely chopped)
* 1/3 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1/4 cup rice vinegar
* 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
* 1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1/4 cup water
* [optional] garnish with chia seeds

### Instructions
1. Prepare the rice (1 cup dry).
2. Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit. On a greased (I used butter, but feel free to use something else that withstand a high temperature) jelly roll pan lay the cauliflower on the flat side and cook for 10 minutes then flip and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
3. In a sauce-pan, on medium high, whisk together the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, maple syrup, vinegar, and oil. Bring to a boil.
4. Mix together, thoroughly, the cornstarch and water. Add to sauce-pan, making sure to stir frequently, and bring to a boil and let thicken while you continue to stir.
5. In a bowl, mix the roasted cauliflower and sauce together.
6. Sprinkle some chia seeds and serve with rice (or any other vegetables).

### Inspired by
I started with this 'Sticky Sesame Cauliflower' <a href="https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2017/01/09/sticky-sesame-cauliflower/" target="_blank">recipe</a>, however I did not have any sesame ingredients!

### Closing
I have been watching some videos with using cauliflower instead of chicken. I have to say, it works pretty well. Sure, the cauliflower is less firm than chicken, but it does a pretty good job, considering. If I was to change this recipe, I would try to bread the cauliflower in some way. I think it would have had the effect I was looking for. I did add broccoli on the side, but it could have definitely used more (by turning this into a stir-fry).

Overall, I am pleased, this was a rather quick recipe to prepare. It only took about 30 minutes from start to finish and it has a bit of a stir fry feel to it without actually needing to fry (unless I am adding more vegetables, of course).

Enjoy, this quick one!
