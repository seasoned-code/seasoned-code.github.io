### Ingredients
* 4 cups mixed berries (can be frozen)
* 1 cup sugar
* 8 teaspoons cornstarch
* 2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
* 6 tablespoons water
+ Two 9-inch <a href="/food/2019/12/01/pie-crusts.html" target="_blank">pie crusts</a>

### Instructions

1. Prepare the pie crusts
2. Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit.
3. In a medium sized bowl, add in the berries, sugar, cornstarch, tapioca and water, then stir.
4. In a 9-inch pie plate, place in the bottom crust. After pour in the fruit filling, evenly. Place the second crust on top, and crimp the two crusts with your preferred method. Cut a few slits on top and place in the oven for 15 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to 350 and cook for an additional 45 minutes, or until golden brown (which if the berries are frozen may take an additional 40 minutes).
6. Let cool so as not to burn yourself!

### Inspired by
I followed this Raspberry Pie <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12235/raspberry-pie-i/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I add less sugar (I even went as little as a quarter cup in the past) and left out the added butter. I also, _always_ used frozen berries.

### Closing
A common holiday request. This was the first pie recipe I've ever made, many years ago (in fact I had this in a binder printed from notepad that I had copy-pasted! For this post I did find the original post). I originally used raspberries, but by request it was suggested I make it with mixed berries. I have not used any other since, because the mixed berries tastes really good and to be truthful, I've never seen a mixed berry pie before this.

What is nice about this one, is that there is little to no prep work. Often, you need to cook the filling, which is not the case for this recipe. Also, I have only used frozen berries, which is great because you never have to feel pressured to prepare the pie before the berries spoil.

This is always a pleaser, so give it a try!
