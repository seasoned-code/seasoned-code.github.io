### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 onion (halved and sliced)
* 3 large red potatoes (diced with skins)
* 2 cups frozen vegetable mix (carrots, peas, green beans and corn)
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 1 1/4 cups vegetable broth
* 1 15 oz can pinto beans
* salt and pepper
* crushed parsley, to garnish

### Instructions
1. Warm frozen vegetables (I chose the microwave).
  - There is no reason not to use fresh vegetables, I just did not have any on hand at the time.
2. Melt butter in large fry pan/skillet on medium heat.
3. Add onion, potatoes and vegetables, and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring constantly, until golden brown.
4. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, continueing to stir constantly.
5. Pour vegetable broth gradually, once again stirring constantly.
6. Add beans and cook for another 5 minutes, or until liquid as burned off. Season with salt and pepper to your liking.
7. Sprinked crushed parsly to garnish, then serve.

### Inspired by
There is no website for this recipe since it came from a book! The recipe is called 'Potato Hash' on page 248 from [Ultimate Vegetarian Recipes, Dempsey Parr Book published 2000, Copyright (C) Parragon 1999], mind my citation!

### Closing
I find this dish is rather straight forward, quick to prepare, and quite tasty! The hardy flavours make it a goto when you want something after being outside in the cold.

As mentioned, feel free to use fresh vegetables. I often substitute fresh for frozen if I do not have any on hand. It is likely that you do not need to thaw the vegetables first, but they will cook a little faster if you do.

Feel free to spice is up by adding some other peppers!
