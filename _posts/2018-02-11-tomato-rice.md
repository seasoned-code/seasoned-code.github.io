### Inspired by
There is no website for this recipe since it came from a book! The recipe is called 'Tomato Rice' on page 190 from [Ultimate Vegetarian Recipes, Dempsey Parr Book published 2000, Copyright (C) Parragon 1999], mind my poor man's citation!

### Closing
_Edit: 2018.08.26: I grossly overstated the olive oil and rice, I realized this after referring to it once_

I had to make a number of substitutions with the recipe since I did not have all of the ingredients. For one, cumin instead of turmeric and I added mustard seeds as well since it called for onion seeds (I know not much of a similarity). Also, original recipe called for canned tomatoes and basmati rice, and I used fresh tomatoes and jasmine rice, respectfully. Overall, I felt it turned out really well. I used half the amount of chili powder, but I would recommend using the suggested of 1 tsp in the future.

Enjoy!
