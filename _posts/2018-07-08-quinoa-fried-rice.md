### Ingredients
* 1/2 cup dried quinoa
* 1 cup of broth or water
* 1/2 cup dried rice
* 1 cup water
* 1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
* 3/4 cup carrots (chopped) 
* 1/2 onion (chopped)
* 3 garlic cloves (minced)
* 1/2 teaspoon ginger root (minced)
* 2 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon butter (liquid form)
* 1 1/2 tablespoon teriyaki sauce
* 2 eggs (slightly beaten)
* 1/2 cup frozen peas (thawed)

### Instructions
1. Separately, prepare quinoa with broth and rice with water and a 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. When it's completed, set aside in the refrigerator or in the freezer till completely cool (not frozen). Even better if you have some left over in the fridge from another day, use that! To make fried rice with the best results is to have it day old, honestly!
2. In a fry-pan on medium high, add 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. When warm saut√© carrots and 1/4 of onions for about two minutes.
3. In the pan, add garlic and ginger, and remaining onion continue cooking for an additional two minutes.
4. While waiting for those two minutes, In a small bowl, mix soy sauce and butter.
5. Add the remaining olive oil, cooled rice, soy sauce mixture and teriyaki sauce to the pan, and continue stirring, constantly, for 2 minutes.
6. Make a well (or I would like a to say a mountain with a hole in it) of the rice. Pour the eggs (lava) into the center of the hole. After doing so, stir the rice over and over while adding the peas. Continue stirring till the eggs are cooked and peas are warm.
7. Serve while it is hot!

### Inspiration
I did a quick search for some rice and quinoa recipes, and I came across a "quinoa fried rice" <a href="https://www.cookingforkeeps.com/quinoa-fried-rice/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. However, it was _only_ quinoa, and I wanted the texture of rice as well, so went with tweaking it a bit. I also added more onion since I did not have any scallions, along with butter instead of sesame oil.

### Closing
This turned out really flavourful. It's important to know, that traditional fried rice depends on day old rice. This time around I did not have any leftover, so I had to make both the quinoa and the rice. This took much longer than I had hoped. I totally recommend breaking this out in the future and making the quinoa and rice on a different day and let it sit in the fridge over night!

Another difference with this recipe is that it uses olive oil. I've seen fried rice cooked with butter, it has a higher temperature threshold. Original recipe wanted to cook on high, but I chose medium-high since it used olive oil.

Ideally, this would work best with something on the side. I was also thinking of adding some shredded brussels sprouts do it, but I completely forgot while I was cooking! Maybe I will do this the next time.

Overall, this is pretty easy to make you just need to keep careful eye when you add the rice and eggs. This is the first time I've made a fried rice where the eggs did not completely get borked. The volcano must have helped, I've never done that before. Also, I was not cooking at too high of a temperature this time around. :)

Enjoy this one!
