### Ingredients
* 6-7 roma tomatoes (peeled and diced)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/4 onion (thinly sliced)
* 2 cloves garlic (minced)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* liberal use of freshly crushed peppercorn
* 2 cups vegetable broth
* 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar

### Instructions
1. In a medium pot on medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. When warm, add onions, garlic, 1 diced tomato, salt, and pepper. Cook until onions are translucent (about 5 minutes).
2. When cooked, set the contents in the pot into a bowl.
3. Back to the pot, (still on medium-high) add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. When warm, add the remaining diced tomatoes. Cook until it starts to liquify (about 10 minutes).
4. Slowly, add the vegetable broth, and bring to a boil.
5. After being brought to a boil, turn the heat down to low. Using an immersion blender, blend the tomatoes until it is no longer chunky.
6. Add the bowl of onion, garlic and tomatoes to the soup, along with the brown sugar. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.
7. You can wait longer and it will taste better, or you can pour yourself a bowl.

### Inspired by
This is not all too different from another recipe of mine, we call it, "The Sauce." At the time of this post, I do not think I have posted that. Both are original. :)

### Closing
If you have some homemade bread, make some grilled cheese with it. Then dip that sandwich in the the soup. It's AMAZING!

I have attempted my hand at a fresh homemade tomato soup in the past, but I did not peel the tomatoes. BIG MISTAKE! You need to peel the tomatoes otherwise it gets this rather gritty texture that is less than desireable.

Also, I have only recently acquired an immersion blender. If you do not have one, you can use a food processor or blender, but the immersion blender works better.

What I like about this is that it has chunky tomatoes in addition to the tomato broth. Very satisfying, indeed!

So, dip (or spoon) away!
