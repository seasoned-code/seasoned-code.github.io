### Ingredients
* 4 teaspoons salt
* 1 cup warm water
* 3 3/4 cups flour
* some flour for kneading surface

### Instructions
1. In a large bowl mix salt and water.
2. Add flour into bowl. Start mixing with a wooden spoon until until water is absorbed.
3. Continue kneading the with hands in the bowl or on a floured surface, until the dough is smooth (about 5-10 minutes). If the dough is sticky instead of smooth, add a little more flour.
4. Make a ball, add a little more flour to surface. Using a rolling pin flatten until thickness is about 1/8 inch at the length of about 8 inches. You may need to make a few flattened discs/squares.
5. In a large pot heat water to a boil (I added a little olive oil, this is not required, to prevent sticking).
6. Make a three fold, and use a chef's knife slice the dough in the same direction that the dough was folded at about a quarter inch width.
7. Unfold the raw noodles while waiting for water to boil.
8. Add noodles to pot (you may need to separate them carefully), stir with a spoon to prevent them from sticking. Cook until they rise to the top of the water, about 6-7 minutes, then drain the water.
9. Add to your preferred dish, or just eat them as they are, they're _that_ good!

### Inspired by
I followed this <a href="https://www.lafujimama.com/how-to-make-handmade-udon-noodles-its-easier-than-you-might-think/" target="_blank">recipe</a>, as a guide. I did not use bread flour, or step on the dough, nor did I let stand for 3-4 hours. I prepared them, and promptly put them in the water.

### Closing
I often hear people say that making noodles is hard. It really is not, it's easier than making bread. If I recall, this was the first noodle recipe I had ever made, and it was an eye-opening experience. What is great about this recipe is that you do not need a stand mixer (okay, you _never_ need one, but it helps often), nor do you need to use a pasta maker.

These taste great, and you can add them to any recipe that requires noodles such as these.

Have fun making them!
