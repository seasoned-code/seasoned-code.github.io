### Inspired by
I was looking for a goulash and stumbled upon this <a href="https://theforkedspoon.com/american-goulash/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. However, once again I have not followed it too closely!

### Closing
I was craving a goulash recipe, something my grandma used to make, comfort food I guess! I think the irony is, I did not find a _Hungarian_ Goulash recipe, but rather an "American" goulash recipe, but used a Hungarian Wax Pepper (from the garden)! I left out the macaroni and cheese (the former a primary ingredient for a goulash). This tasted more like a chilli, but it did not use any chillies! In the end this was more of a soup. I was feeling a little under the weather, and this most definitely cleared the sinuses!

Because it's not a goulash, and since it uses a Hungarian Wax Pepper, I will name it, *Hungarian Woulash*, fine, it sounds corny, but I am cool with that.

The next time, I will not likely add the TVP, I do not feel it added much to the experience, and the beans did a really good job. However, maybe I will add barley instead (I thought about it instead of macaroni).

Enjoy this steaming pot of spice!
