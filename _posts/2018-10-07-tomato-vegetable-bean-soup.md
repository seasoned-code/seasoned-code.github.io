### Instructions

### Inspired by
I based the recipe off of <a href="https://www.hummusapien.com/vegetable-soup/" target="_blank">this</a>. I changed a few things, and I was not all too precise on others. The original recipe had less beans, and no barley or cayenne pepper.

### Closing
Awww so so good! Today, was a cold and rainy autumn day and this was great! However, others felt it had a little too much heat, due to the cayenne pepper. Interestingly enough, this tasted much like minestrone, unintentionally. I actually peeled the tomatoes this time around before adding them to the soup. I went all out and also baked some bread, it was a splendid compliment to this meal.

Moving forward, I think I will try to add barley to most soups that I make. I really like pasta, but they tend to bloat, but barley, yes, barley is a great alternative!

Enjoy the steamy bowl..... with the bread!
