### Ingredients
* 1 cup brown rice
* 1 cup quinoa
* 4 carrots (cut into narrow shape)
* 4 celery stalks (cut into narrow shape)
* 1.5 cups frozen broccoli (steamed/microwaved)

+ Favourite teriyaki sauce (recipe below)
  - 1⁄4 cup soy sauce
  - 1 cup water
  - 1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger
  - 1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 5 tablespoons packed brown sugar
  - 1 -2 tablespoon honey
  - 2 tablespoons cornstarch
  - 1⁄4 cup cold water

### Instructions
1. Start cooking brown rice (1 cup rice with 2 cups water, I add a little olive oil).
2. Start cooking quinoa (1 cup quinoa 2 cups water, I added a little vegetable stock, it is not likely necessary).
3. The sauce: In a small sauce pan add all ingredients minus the 2 tablespoons cornstarch and the 1/4 cup cold water. I cooked on medium heat until it started to boil.
4. In a separate small bowl, mix cornstarch and 1/4 cup water until is entirely disolved. Then add to the sauce pan. It will thicken up pretty quickly and you will want to stir it. If it's too think add more water. Turn heat to low or turn it off.
5. Prepare vegetables to your liking. I used the above because that is all I had in the fridge, get creative! This recipe, does not require you to cook your vegetables, so do not feel the need to stir fry them.
6. When rice and quinoa are complete, add to your bowl, then add vegetables and lastly spoon some teriyaki sauce on top. I found that a little went a long way!

### Inspired by
If you have ever had a meal from <a href="https://www.freshii.com">FRESHII</a>, I would recommend it. The first time I was there, I picked up their menu and I have been using it for ideas ever since. They use, predominately, fresh ingredients. This recipe, for the most part (except for the sauce), is original, but I would not be telling the truth if there was not inspiration from else where. The sauce came from the following <a href="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/restaurant-teriyaki-sauce-133751">link</a>.

### Closing
The dish was a fun one to make. It is pretty quick except for preparing the rice, and that is not too bad if you plan ahead of time. I cut the vegetables a little larger than I would the next time. Also, the sauce recipe above I was able to freeze into two dishes after the meal was over. A little forewarning that the sauce jellies a little after being frozen, but still tastes really good!
