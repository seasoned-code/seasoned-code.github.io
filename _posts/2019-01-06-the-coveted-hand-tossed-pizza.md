### Ingredients
* 2 1/2 cups flour
* 1/4 cups flaxseed
* 1/4 cups wheat germ
* 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
* 1/2 tablespoon dry active yeast
* 3/8 tsp salt
* 1 cup luke warm water
* 1 tbs olive oil
* [Optional]
  * A little more olive oil
  * Few shakes garlic powder
  * Few shakes crushed peppercorn 
* <a href="/food/2019/01/06/pizza-sauces.html" target="_blank">Sauce</a>
* Mozzarella Cheese (shredded)
* Toppings

### Instructions
1. While warming the water in the microwave for one minute. Combine all dry ingredients into bowl. Put on stand mixer and mix with water till turns into ball. Add more flour if it's too damp or a little water if it is too dry.
2. After dough has a smooth elastic consistency, drizzle oil on top and let rise for 1 hour covered with a cloth in a warm place.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit.
4. Take dough out of bowl, onto the floured the surface of a pizza pan. Flatten the dough onto the pizza pan. After it has been flattened to your liking, feel free to lift one side at a time and place some cornmeal underneath.
  * [Optional] Combine the "little more olive oil", garlic powder and crushed peppercorn and spread over top of dough.
5. Bake for 7 minutes on pizza pan (or baking sheet).
6. Take crust out of the oven. Set oven to 425.
7. Add sauce, cheese, and ingredients to crust.
8. This is the tricky part. Put back in the oven on the bottom rack, *directly with no baking sheet* (if you do not have a pizza peel use a cookie sheet to slide off the pan), for four minutes.
9. _Note, I usually turn on the broiler for this step_. Move the pizza to the top rack (with no pan) for two to four minutes or until it has the desired crispiness. *Make sure to keep an eye on it when using the broiler!*
10. Remove from oven and let cool on pizza sheet then slice away and devour!

### Closing
Where to begin. It's the pizza, really, that started everything for me. I originally was afraid of yeast, and used other forms of getting a crust to rise. It just did not taste well. So, I ventured into yeast recipes, and at first I was not all too successful. I really struggled with getting the crust crispy when baking on a cookie sheet. So, I ventured into pan pizzas with *this* recipe. Eventually, moving onto pizza pans with mixing between prepping the crust to baking directly on the racks.

I've been holding on to this recipe for a while, I really do not know why (actually I do I have it memorized and it represents so much for me). I have gone through a number of crusts recipes, and this one just is it (after some modification). It is one of my and family's favourites, hands down. What I love about this is that the pizza, if done right, will have a slightly crunchy bottom and crispy top. It tastes wonderful, and you do not even need to have a baking stone (even though having one makes it easier). I have really perfected this process to more of a science than I usually do for my recipes.

Also, another bit about this dough, is that it is versatile. You can make a pan pizza with it, and if you have the right sauce you could make it taste nearly identical to a <a href="https://rockyrococo.com/" target="_blank">Rocky Rococo</a> pan style pizza. I will likely share that process later.

Often, I will double the recipe at the same time and split the dough in two before I let it rise. There is a bit of a juggle, but you can essentially stagger the two pizzas in the oven at the same time (something you cannot do with a baking stone).

In the end of all of this. I much prefer my pizza over a restaurant's, and I have fun doing it!

Try it, and you will not be disappointed!
