### Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups red lentils (dry/uncooked)
* 4 1/2 cups water
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3/4 cup oat flour
* 1/3 onion (chopped)
* 2 garlic cloves (minced)
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon basil
* 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed
* 1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* salt and pepper (optional)
* ketchup (optional)

### Instructions
1. In a pot on high, adding lentils, water, and olive oil. Cook for about 20-25 minutes until water is, for the most part, absorbed or evaporated.
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit.
3. In a large bowl, mix together flour, onions, garlic, ginger, oregano, basil, flaxseed, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, mustard and 2 cups cooked lentils. After everything is thoroughly mixed, stir in the remaining lentils. Optionally, salt and pepper as you desire.
4. In a bread pan, either grease or line with parchment paper (I side with the latter). Add lentil mixture into pan evenly. Spread a layer of ketchup on top.
5. Place in the oven for 25-30 minutes, the edges should be brown/crispy.
6. Let cool for a few minutes before slicing.

### Inspired by
I followed this <a href="https://www.grit.com/food/recipes/vegetarian-meat-loaf-recipe-ze0z1501zcwil" target="_blank">recipe</a> pretty closely. I milled my own flour from steel cut oats (by far the easiest grain to mill that I have experienced). I recommend using red lentils, other lentils (green?) do not keep together very well. I also did not make the traditional brown sugar and ketchup topping and used far less ketchup. I also did not use a food processor.

### Closing
This tasted pretty, pretty good. I have been into "comfort" food as of late, it must be the weather, or something. So it's nice to make something that has a pretty good texture and flavour. I might add some salt and pepper the next time, I neglected because I had forgotten more so than making a conscious decision. I added vegetables on the side, potato "cottage fries" included.

The type of lentils does make a big difference. I have used other types of lentils, and the texture, flavour, and cohesiveness is better with red lentils, in my opinion. That being said, I only have two to choose from at my local grocer. I might try to adding some TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein) to give it some more "meaty" texture in the future.

Give this a go, and see how you like it!
