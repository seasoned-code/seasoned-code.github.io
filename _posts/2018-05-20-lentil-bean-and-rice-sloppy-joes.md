### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 cup lentils (uncooked)
* 1/3 cup rice (uncooked)
* 1 15oz can of pinto beans (rinsed)
* 1/2 onion (finely chopped)
* 1 carrot (finely chopped)
* 1/2 bell pepper (finely chopped)
* 1/2 cup ketchup
* 2 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
* 1/4 teaspoon oregano
* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (preferably vegetarian)
* liberal use of ground pepper

### Instructions
1. Prepare the rice and lentils based on your type, I add a little olive oil to each.
2. When the rice and lentils are done cooking-- in a pot heat olive oil on medium-high. When warm add onion, carrot, bell pepper and about two tablespoons ketchup and cook for about 3 minutes.
3. Stir in the garlic for about 30 seconds.
4. Add cooked lentils and rice, beans, oregano, remaining ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, pepper with an additional 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low. Continue to cook for an additional 10 minutes, until sauce thickens.
5. Serve on your preferred buns, maybe a with some lettuce and a tomato slice. Serving with a salad on the side can balance the heaviness as well.

### Inspiration
Funny thing, this <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/lentil-sloppy-joes-recipe-2109517" target="_blank">recipe</a> is not actually vegetarian. However, I made it into one (also using a vegetarian Worcestershire sauce). I liked the number of vegetables that went into it so it worked really well. I, also, did not follow all the steps to a T, go figure!?

### Closing
Surprisingly, this is a very satisfying rendition. Originally, I did not add the beans or the rice, but I felt the former adds some nice texture while the latter makes this a complete protein. _shh do not mention this, but really,I added the beans because I unknowingly did not have enough lentils for my original recipe, but turns out I really like it this way!_

In the past, I have added freshly diced tomato to the sauce and have experimented with less ketchup.

It keeps really well in the fridge, too!

This adds a nice recipe to the repertoire for a summer meal!
