### Inspired by
 I based off a <a href="https://ministryofcurry.com/madras-lentils-daal-makhani-instant-pot#wprm-recipe-container-8955" target="_blank">Madras/Daal recipe</a>. This was a second attempt at it, but this time around I followed less closely and went with more a chili expectation.

### Closing
I, originally, started to make chili, but then I decided to give the madras/daal lentil recipe a second try. I did not enjoy it as much the first time as I did this time. It's possible I was hoping it would taste like something else that I was trying to copy-cat. This time around, I held no expectations, so I think I enjoyed it more. Since I did not follow the recipe too closely, I did not feel it was a true madras/daal. Maybe it still is, but this was more like a soup than a sauce to be used with rice.

I did use pasta (spaghetti) with this (I prepared it on the side). It allowed for the complete protein. Yes, I know, chili does not use pasta, but I was feeling a little nostalgic and wanted something my grandmother used to make (minus the whole curry part)! Feel free to use rice as well.

This definitely hit the spot on a cold wintry day!
