### Closing
If a peasant had a microwave this would be it, it is so simple and filling. You could exchange the word, 'Peasant' with, 'College Student living in a dorm,' too! ;)

Surprisingly, you can do a lot with a microwave, if you're looking for a quick, 'whip up a relatively nutritious meal,' this is it!
