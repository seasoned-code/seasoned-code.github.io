### Ingredients
* 1 cup thinly sliced carrots
* 1 cup frozen green peas
* 1 cup small diced potatoes (if red or gold leave peels)
* 1/2 cup thinly sliced celery
* 3/4 cup water
* 1/3 cup finely chopped onion
* 1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
* 1/3 cup oat flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper (I am a little more liberal on this)
* 1/4 teaspoon parsley flakes
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 2 cups vegetable broth
* 2/3 cup milk (whole) 
* 1 15oz can of Great Northern Beans (undrained)

### Instructions
1. In a medium sized pot on medium-high, add carrots, potatoes, celery, peas, and water. Cook till vegetables are tender (about 15 minutes). Do not drain the water, keep this for the soup!
2. In a large pot, on medium add butter.
3. When butter has melted, add onions, cook till translucent (about 5 minutes).
4. Add flour, salt, pepper, parsley flakes and garlic. Cook for about 2 minutes.
5. Slowly add vegetable broth and milk. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook till thickens (about 5 minutes).
6. When broth has thickened add vegetables and beans. Reduce heat to simmer, cook for a minute or two.
7. Serve!

### Inspired by

If this looks familiar, it's because it is! Essentially, this is the filling to the Chickenless Vegetarian Pot Pie <a href="/food/2017/12/31/chickenless-vegetarian-pot-pie.html" target="_blank">recipe</a>! There is a little added liquid, but aside from that, pretty much unchanged. I have been using oat flour in place of wheat flour as well.

### Closing

What makes a great soup on a cold (or holi) day? A pie filling! What makes this even better? Some <a href="/food/2018/12/30/italian-bread.html" target="_blank">Italian Bread</a> on the side!

Now, eating this in one sitting is a little much. I am uncertain how well this will keep in the fridge, so this might be a great recipe if you have a few guests over and you have other side items.

Try a cup, and it might turn into a bowl!
