### Ingredients
* 5 Roma Tomatoes (diced)
* ½ an onion (chopped)
* ⅓ cup chopped black olives
* 1 15oz can of chickpeas (drained)
* 1 tablespoon black olive brine (from your can/jar of olives)
* 3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
* ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 teaspoon Dried parsley
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Salt, if necessary

### Instructions
1. In a medium saucepan, heat oil at medium high. When oil is warm saute onion for about 3 minutes.
2. Add the tomato sauce, olives, chickpeas, olive brine, garlic and red pepper flakes. Over medium-high heat bring to simmer, then reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes.
3. Remove the sauce from heat and add parsley. Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper and salt.
4. Use sauce on desired pasta of choice.

### Inspired by
I would like to give some credit where credit is due! I started off with this <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/2016/vegan-spaghetti-alla-puttanesca/" target="_blank">link</a> for inspiration, but overall the recipe I ended up with is a bit different.


### Closing
The sauce is a bit on the spicey side, but not heavy and with chickpeas leaves you with some protein, which I feel is really hard with vegetarian dishes if you are not accustomed to relying on beans and lagumes in your dishes.
