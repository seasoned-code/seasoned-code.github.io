### Ingredients
* tablespoon olive oil
* 2 slices of onion (minced)
* [optional] small garlic clove (minced)
* 1 15oz can of beans
* liberal use of crushed peppercorn
* salt if necessary, often beans have salt included

### Instructions
1. Heat saucepan on medium high, when warm saut√© onion (and optionally garlic) for about one minute.
2. Add beans with liquid and pepper, bring to a boil.
3. Reduce heat to medium, using a potato masher mash the beans until smooth or only slightly lumpy. Continue cooking until thickens, stirring frequently (otherwise it will burn on the bottom).
4. Serve!

### Closing
This is a super easy, "refried beans," that are quite tasty. Whenever I buy a can of refried beans, they always add a whole bunch of stuff that I do not feel needs to be necessary.

Also, I've made this with both pinto and great northern beans, and they're fabulous. Black beans does not turn out quite as well, not sure why.

Add this as a side or a condiment to a taco/burrito meal!
