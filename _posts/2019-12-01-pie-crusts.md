### Ingredients
* 1 1/4 cups flour
* 1/8 cup wheatgerm
* 1/8 cup flaxseed
* 1 stick cold butter (cut into small pieces)
* 1 tablespoon sugar (if a savory crust leave this out)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt (if you used salted butter this may not be necessary)
* 4-5 tablespoon ice water

### Instructions
1. In a stand mixer combine the flour, wheatgerm, flaxseed, sugar (if including) and salt. Mix the ingredients.
2. Add butter and start mixing until starts to clump.
3. Add water (you can start with the 4 tablespoons but I always found I needed the 5th) and continue to mix till just about into a ball.
4. On a flour dusted flat surface flatten the ball to a disc with a rolling pin.
5. When at desired thickness and width place in refrigerator till needed.

Note: About the pie crusts, many people dread making a crust. Overall, they are not too challenging, easier than making a yeast breads. Also, I know I am not preparing everything as suggested (such as letting the dough sit in the refrigerator for an hour or so before flattening, but I do not generally have the time, in addition, I have not had a crust that I did not like. Or maybe I am not too picky?)!

### Inspired by

I adapted the following <a href="https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/basic-pie-dough-10746" target="_blank">crust recipe</a> which I did not follow to a T.

### Closing

This is my goto pie crust recipe. You might notice that this was used (predominately) with the <a href="/food/2017/12/31/chickenless-vegetarian-pot-pie.html" target="_blank">Chickenless Pot Pie</a>. Since I am adding more pies, I figured a centralized post makes sense. If you're making a savory pie, feel free to leave out the sugar. 

Some might balk that adding nutrition seems counter intuitive to a fruit pie, but that's what I do. I actually like the added crunch. :)
