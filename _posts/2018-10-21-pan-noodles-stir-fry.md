### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

### Inspired by
I very loosely followed this given <a href="http://www.recipe4living.com/recipes/copycat_noodles_and_co_japanese_pan_noodles.htm" target="_blank">recipe</a>. It's actually a copycat of Noodles and Company's "Japanese Pan Noodles." It does not use quite as many carrots, nor did it have chickpeas or celery. Some ingredients I did not even have, so I either substituted (white wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar) or left out all together (mushrooms).

### Closing
This is a fun one. I love the texture of udon noodles. This last rendition I did not quite slice the noodles narrow enough, so they were slightly thicker than I had intended. 

I used chickpeas to assist with some protein, but the texture is not quite what I am looking for. It was the first time I had used the chickpeas, so we will see if I try something else next time in its place. However, I feel you do need the protein, otherwise you will just be left feeling unsatisfied.

I would have added mushrooms, but I did not have any to add, so I left those out. However, I did add celery which added a crunch.

If you made another recipe that used teriyaki sauce (we have a couple others, here!), you might still have some in the freezer! It was really easy to just scoop it out with a spoon despite it being frozen. I _may_ not have added enough teriyaki, so feel free to add more.

How would you make this differently?
