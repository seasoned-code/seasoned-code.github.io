### Ingredients
* 4 celery stalks (chopped)
* 5 carrots (cut into sticks) [optionally use rainbow carrots!]
* 12 little potatoes (halved with skins)
* 1 onion (sliced)
* 2 garlic cloves (sliced)
* 3/4 cup frozen green peas
* 3/4 cup water
* 3 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon rosemary
* salt and pepper
* 1 cup dry quinoa
* 2 cups vegetable broth

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit
2. In a 13x9 cake pan add celery, carrots, potatoes, onions, garlic, and green peas. Pour water, drizzle olive oil and sprinkle rosemary. Salt and pepper to your liking.
  - To assist with clean-up, lining pan with aluminum foil can help.
3. Cover pan with aluminum foil and place in oven for 45-50 minutes.
4. Prepare quinoa (takes about 20 minutes), follow directions from your packaging, but use vegetable broth instead of water.
5. Serve with quinoa topped with vegetables.

### Closing
Roasts are another one of those comfort food meals that are great on a cold day! Also, they are relatively easy to prepare! I grew up eating roasts with a meat, but this one does a pretty good job with flavour even without the meat and there is just something about eating the tender potatoes!

Stay warm and enjoy a comforting dish!
