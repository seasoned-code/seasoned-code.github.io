### Ingredients
* 3 1/2 cups flour
* 1/4 cup flaxseed
* 1/4 cup wheat germ
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1-1 1/2 cups buttemilk
  * I used milk with lemon juice (1 tablespoon juice per 1 cup milk let sit for 10-15 minutes)

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425 degees fahrenheit.
2. In a bowl combine all dry ingredients and mix briefly.
3. Add 1 cup of buttermilk and start mixing (I used standmixer with breadhook) until is forms to a ball. If you are noticing that it is still too dry, add more buttermilk 1 tablespoon at a time.
4. On a floured surface knead briefly and turn to a round loaf and cut an X on it about a half inch in depth.
5. Place on a floured cookie sheet and place into oven for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown on top.
6. Serve promptly after out of oven.

### Inspired by
Majority of this recipe came from, <a href="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/traditional-irish-soda-bread-160379" target="_blank">here</a>. Naturally, there were some modifications. :) Also, this was a useful <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-make-a-buttermilk-substitute-4145341" target="_blank">resource</a> for butter milk substitutes.

### Closing
Overall, this is a really easy recipe that requires very little prep, aside from the making of a substitute buttermilk (which just fascinates me for some reason). I will, definitely, try my hand at making this again, it tastes really good! Also, I do not make many breads that are not yeast based. So this is another nice perk about it-- no rise time!
