### Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 onion (sliced)
* 5 carrots (chopped)
* 4 celery stalks (chopped)
* 1 green bell pepper (chopped)
* 12 cups water
* 2 cups cabbage (chopped)
* ¼ dried splitpeas
* 1 15oz can of chickpeas (undrained)
* <a href="http://www.orringtonfarms.com/category/recipes/vegan-broth-base-seasoning-vegetable/" target="_blank">Vegetable broth base powder</a>
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Salt, if necessary

### Instructions
1. In a large soup pot heat olive oil on medium high
2. When oil is warm, sauté onions for 5 minutes. Then add carrots, followed by celery and bell pepper. Continue cooking until the onions are golden brown.
3. Add water, cabbage, dried splitpeas, and chickpeas. Bring to a boil.
4. Reduce heat to medium low. Add vegetable broth powder as specified for 6-8 cups water (I did not need to add the full allotment)
5. I did not measure, but I liberally applied black pepper and salted a little bit.
6. Let cook for about an hour and a half to two hours, then feel free to serve!

### Closing
 The soup has a mild flavor I found quite enjoyable. I would like to include, this is a different soup than I traditionally prepare. With that said, most of my vegetable soups consist of what I have on hand. The next time I make this, I would substitute the chickpeas with a bean. Give it a shot!
