### Ingredients
* 1 1/2 onions (minced)
* 4 garlic cloves (minced)
* 2 tablespoon olive oil
* 33 oz jar artichokes (drained, ideally non-marinated)
* 4 tomatoes (diced)
* 2/3 cup white wine (or apple juice)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon basil
* 1/2 teaspoon oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon thyme
* liberal use of crushed pepper corn
* 1/3 cup black olives (sliced)
* 1 15 oz can chickpeas (drained)
* 1 cup rice (of your choice)
* 1 cup quinoa (cooked in broth of your choice)

### Instructions
1. Prepare rice and quinoa.
2. In a large pot add olive oil and heat on medium. When oil is warm, add onions and garlic and saut√© until onions are translucent (about 3 minutes).
3. Add artichokes and cook for an additional 2 minutes. I usually separate the artichokes with a fork and butter knife while in the pan.
4. Add in tomatoes, wine, salt, basil, oregano, thyme, crushed pepper, olives, and chickpeas. Stir and reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes.
5. Serve on top of rice and quinoa.

### Inspiration
This is a family recipe. I do not know where its origins lie, but it's really good. Naturally, I've modified it a bit. The chickpeas and quinoa was the largest difference, since they were not originally included. In addition, feel free to use a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, I prefer the latter. Also, this recipe, for the most part is doubled in regards to onions, garlic and artichokes.

### Closing
This is one of those comfort foods that stores really, really well in the fridge. This batch is enough to give you a number of meals following the original preparation and I love it for that! It is also another one of those family favourites that you just cannot get enough of!

I do not have any other recipes that call for artichokes, but do I love its texture! The original recipe called for non-marinated artichokes, but I do not usually go out of my way to find any. I just make sure to drain them before adding to the pot.

Originally, the meal had very little protein. However, I had added the chickpeas and just this last time preparing, I added the quinoa, and I am pleasantly surprised how well it turned out with it! With these two additions, there is a complete protein, and that just makes me super excited!

Enjoy this comfort-food dish, it is splendid!
