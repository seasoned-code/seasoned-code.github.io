### Ingredients
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 lb (about 23) fresh Brussels Sprouts (trimmed and halved)
* 2 large carrots (cubed)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* liberal use of crushed pepper corn
* 1/3 cup water
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice

### Instructions
1. In a large skillet/fry pan, heat olive oil on medium-high. When warm, add Brussels Sprouts, carrots, salt and pepper. Stirring frequently, cook until caramelized (about 8-10 minutes).
2. Add water, while continuing to stir, and cook until water has evaporated (about 2-4 minutes).
3. Place directly into serving bowl and splash with lemon juice.
4. Serve with your main dish!

### Inspiration
Looking up recipes for Brussels Sprouts lead me to a Marth Stewart <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/316075/sauteed-brussels-sprouts" target="_blank">rendition</a>. However, hers did not include carrot.

### Closing
This turned out really nicely! Often, Brussels Sprouts have a bit of a bitter flavour, but the carrot sweetened it a little along with the lemon juice helped make it a little tangy. This was an excellent compliment to a meal, even though the manner I took was backwards. I was looking for a main course with _this_ recipe!

I cooked this beside garlic-onion chickpeas and rosemary olive oil roasted mini-potatoes. The flavours of all three was just a fantastic meal and was very fulfilling!
