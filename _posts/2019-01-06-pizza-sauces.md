### Ingredients
* 1 15oz can crushed tomatoes

### Instructions
1. [Skip if not using 5-6 tomatoes]
  * a. In a medium sauce pan boil water
  * b. Blanch tomatoes in boiling water for about 1 minute to remove peels
  * c. When cool remove peels, and cut into 4 parts

2. Combine all ingredients into sauce pan bring to boil then reduce heat.

### Inspired by
This was a family restaurant's recipe, modified to fit something for the home by reducing quantity and ratio of oregano and parsley. You would likely have enough for about 3-4 pizzas. Also, the original did not use fresh tomatoes, it added a nice touch.

### Inspired by
Looking to follow a copycat that does not really taste like its <a href="https://www.sixsistersstuff.com/recipe/copycat-papa-johns-pizza-recipe/" target="_blank">copycat</a>. It's a little on the sweet side, but it's pretty good.

### Closing
There are many to sauces to choose from. I really enjoy the "family restaurant's."
