### Ingredients
* 8 cups cabbage (shredded)
* 2 carrots (diced)
* 6-8 radishes (chopped)
* 2 green onions (sliced)
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons white vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon crushed peppercorn

### Instructions
1. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix, thoroughly.
2. It is suggested you let sit for 2 hours, but I found it tasted best overnight.


### Inspired by
I predominately used this <a href="https://dinnerthendessert.com/easy-cole-slaw/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I made a few changes, such as adding more cabbage and reducing the mayo and sugar (they used granulated variety) while adding radishes and green onions.

### Closing
I had extra cabbage from the <a href="/food/2019/03/24/st-patricks-day-irish-meal-take-2.html" target="_blank">Irish meal</a>, so I made two renditions of this recipe... it was so good the first time that I doubled it the second (and took a picture)! This meal goes really well with a picnic/bbq style meal, so give it a go! It also tastes super good leftover the following day, so do not feel you need to rush to eat all in one sitting!
