### Ingredients
* 2 cups water (luke warm)
* 5 1/2 cups flour
* 1/4 cup milled flaxseed
* 1/4 cup wheatgerm
* 6 1/2 teaspoons dry active yeast
* 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt

### Instructions
1. Combine yeast, flour, flaxseed, wheatgerm, sugar into a bowl (preferably a stand mixer bowl). Follow by mixing with a spoon and breaking down the brown sugar.
2. Add the water (I had warmed it in the microwave for about a minute and a half), if you have a stand mixer mix till it is thoroughly a damp blob. Add in the olive oil and salt and continue mixing for an additional 8-10 minutes until it is a soft and elastic ball.
3. Drizzle a little additional oil on the ball and cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 1/2 hours.
4. Preheat oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit.
5. Take dough out on floured surface and punch followed by two folds under. Let rise for another 15 minutes or so.
6. Transfer to baking sheet with some cornmeal. Cut four deep slits at a 45 degree angle on the top of the loaf. Place in oven and bake for 45-55 minutes or until crust is hard and giving a few whacks with wooden spoon results in a hollow thump. 

### Inspired by
I based off this <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/basic-italian-bread-3644964" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I made a few changes, such as using dry active yeast, and did not use egg white or sesame seeds.

### Closing
This is a fun recipe. The dough has a consistency that reminds me of pizza dough. It's fantastic, and it tastes just great! I recently acquired a baking stone, and it really gave it a nice taste too. You might be able to half the recipe if you would like to have a smaller loaf.

If you would like a crispier crust, you could always add a pan with water in the oven while it bakes. The original recipe talked about splashing water on the outside while it bakes. I am not particularly fond with the latter approach.

Give it a go!
