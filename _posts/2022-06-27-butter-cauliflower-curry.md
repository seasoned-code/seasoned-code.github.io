### Instructions
1. Starting with the tomato sauce (skip this step if you are using a can of sauce). In a medium sized pot on medium-high heat olive oil. When warm, add the onions and garlic. After onions are translucent, add the tomatoes. Increase heat to high. Stiring on occasion, continue to cook until the sauce breaks down and reduces in size to about 15 ozs. While the tomatoes are cooking, prepare the rest of the vegetables.
2. Prepare the rice adding all ingredients together. I used a pressure cooker, so I waited towards the end, but if you're cooking on the stove you will likely want to start sooner rather than later.
2. In a large pot or soup cauldron on medium-high, add in butter. When warm, add garlic and onions. Cook till translucent.
3. Add ginger, garam masala, chili powder, cumin and tomato paste. Cook for about a minute. Then add tomato sauce, vegetable broth, salt and pepper to taste. Bring to boil.
4. In a pot (I reused the tomato sauce pot) on high add in milk and coconut/almond milk creamer. Cook till reduced to size.
5. Stir in cauliflower and reduce heat to medium-low, then cover. Cook till cauliflower is tender ( about 10 minutes).
6. Stir in the milk/creamer, then add the parsley.
7. Serve with the rice, and if you have it, naan!

### Inspiration
I had <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/butter-cauliflower-bowls" target="_blank">this</a> recipe saved for a while. I just have not made it until yesterday! I took some liberties, made my own tomato sauce, and used oat milk with some coconut and almond creamer for a heavy whipping cream substitute. I did not have vegetable stock so I used broth and lastly parsley instead of cilantro.

### Closing
It has been a looooooooong while, but I just had to post it as this is by far the BEST curry _I_ have ever made. I mean, I said that in other curry posts, too, but this one takes the cake. It was fantastic. I will definitely need to make this one again! I did not make the naan homemade this time, but I had some in the fridge from the store. I did butter it and added a little garlic powder and parsley before cooking it in the the toaster oven for a few minutes.

Well, that is all, happy cooking!
