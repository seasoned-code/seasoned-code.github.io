### Ingredients
#### Vegetables
* 2 cups brown rice (cooked)
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1 cup broccoli florets (chopped)
* 2-3 carrots (diced)
* a bunch of green beans (ends clipped)
* 1/2 small onion (chopped)
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1 15oz can chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
* 3/4 cup cashews (roasted and unsalted)

#### Sauce
* 2 teaspoons ginger (grated/finely chopped)
* 2 garlic cloves (chopped)
* 2/3 cup vegetable broth
* 4 tablespoon soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* [optional] 1/4 teaspoons red pepper flakes (or a different pepper)

### Instructions
1. Prepare the rice (1 cup dry).
2. Prepare all the vegetables, including those for the sauce. When it comes to a stir-fry, getting everything done up front is the key!
3. Combine all Sauce ingredients together in a bowl.
4. Combine cornstarch and water in a small bowl and mix until no clumps are present.
5. In a wok or large fry-pan add oil on medium-high. When warm, add broccoli, carrots, green beans, most of the onions (set remainder to the side for garnish). Cook for 3-5 minutes until broccoli is cooked (the others do not take as long).
6. Add sauce, chickpeas and cashews, and cook for a minute, or until it starts to simmer.
7. Add cornstarch mixture and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until sauce thickens.
8. Place into serving dish, garnish with the remaining onions!

### Inspired by
I started with this <a href="https://mealplans.cooksmarts.com/recipes/1238-cashew-chicken-and-broccoli?version=vegetarian" target="_blank">recipe</a>, however aside from the sauce I deviated pretty heavily.

### Closing
I have had a wok for years, but rarely used it, until recently. My last couple stir-fries I decided to break it out. It's relatively large and makes it hard to shake, so I have to stir the vegetables instead.

I have been wanting a good vegetarian cashew chicken recipe for a while, and I feel chickpeas are the way to go! The key is the sauce, naturally. I did not have fresh broccoli, and used frozen, but everything else was fresh. I am really happy with how this turned out, and it felt like bought it from a restaurant, but with less grease! I did not add the red pepper to the sauce, however, I did chop up a jalape√±o and garnished with the spare onion. Aside from the cashew, I think the broccoli makes it work because it just soaks in the flavours.

Give this a go, you will not be disappointed!
