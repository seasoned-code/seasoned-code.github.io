### Closing
Originally, I did not make this as mini potpies, but I gave it another go the following week after thinking it would make a good filling. I made the "filling" based on what I had in the pantry and I was quite surprised how it turned out. The next time I make this I might not even make it as a potpie, but rather just have it as a biscuits and gravy.

I am sure you will not be disappointed when you want some comfort food at a personal level!
