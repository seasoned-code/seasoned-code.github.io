### Ingredients
* 1 cup of rice or pasta
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 4 mushrooms (sliced)
* 1/2 onion (thinly sliced)
* 2 cloves garlic (finely chopped)
* 15oz can chickpeas (separate chickpeas from liquid)
* 1 teaspoon 'Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Broth'
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1/2 cup coconut buttermilk (use half tablespoon lemon juice)

### Instructions
1. Prepare rice or pasta.
2. In frypan add olive oil and butter on medium-high. When warm add onions, cook until lightly brown.
3. Add mushrooms, garlic, and chickpeas sans liquid (set aside) then cover. Cook for 6 minutes.
4. Mix the bouillon and chickpeas liquid and add to the frypan. Cook until it starts to thicken, uncovered.
5. In a small pot cook the coconut buttermilk on high till it thickens.
6. Add the buttermilk and mustard to the frypan and continue to cook until it thickens.
7. Serve over rice of pasta.

### Inspiration
I started with <a href="http://www.savoryreviews.com/2009/10/25/mushroom-stroganoff/" target="_blank">this</a>. Original did not inclue a protein, so I added chickpeas. It also called for a lot more mushrooms. I did not have anymore to add, so I only used half the onion.

### Closing
This is not the first time I made this, but it is the best it has ever turned out. It was the first time that I used coconut milk. I really liked it.

Growing up we had stroganoff all the time, though that recipe was usually with beef and sometimes chicken, it also included water chestnuts. We interchanged between rice and pasta. Rice is a healthier choice. I liked the rice.

I would double this the next time-- I just need more mushrooms!
