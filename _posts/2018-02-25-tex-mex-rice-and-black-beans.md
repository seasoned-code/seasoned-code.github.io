### Inspired by
This started from one recipe which was quite bland with some additional liberties taken from another through a <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/15559/black-beans-and-rice/reviews/271264/" target="_blank">comment</a> on the original <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/15559/black-beans-and-rice/" target="_blank">recipe</a>.

### Closing
This is a really an inexpensive dish, that has some zip to it. The tomato balances some of the heat (and if there is not enough, add more [heat]!). I am not overly fond of beans and rice alone, but I think I will make it like this moving forward. I am sure you can think of something that will make it better than this, such as swapping out the beans for another variety!

Either way, enjoy a thrifty meal!
