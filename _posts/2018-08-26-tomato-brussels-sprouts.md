### Ingredients
* prepared rice and quinoa
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 onion (sliced)
* 1 pound Brussels sprouts (halved)
* 1/2 teaspoon ginger root (minced)
* 6-8 Roma tomatoes (thickly sliced)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* liberal use of crushed peppercorn

### Instructions
1. Prepare the quinoa and/or rice. Having the quinoa will assist with having a protein.
2. In a fry pan, on medium-high, when warm add the onions and saut√© for about 2 minutes.
3. Add the remaining ingredients and cook until the sauce has thickened, about 10-15 minutes or so.
4. Serve on top of the quinoa and rice.

### Closing
Simple recipe, that has a lot of good flavours, brought out by the onion and ginger. I had a number of Brussels sprouts in the fridge, and I was figuring what else I could do with them. When looking up recipes, it gets pretty much the same. Often, it includes bacon in one form or another.

I have tried some other recipes, going as far as including Brussels sprouts in a soup that turned out pretty nicely as well. I will try to focus more on Brussels sprouts in the future.

Enjoy!
