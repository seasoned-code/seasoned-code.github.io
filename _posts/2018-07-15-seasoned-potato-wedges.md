### Ingredients
* 1 lb potatoes (cut into wedges)
* 1-2 tablespoons olive oil
* few shakes salt
* liberal use of freshly ground pepper corn
* few shakes garlic powder

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven at 375 degrees fahrenheit.
2. On a baking sheet, (feel to free to use aluminum foil, it will help with clean-up and placing into bowl) spread the oil (I used a spoon). Sprinkle the salt, pepper and garlic powder on the oiled surface.
3. Evenly distribute the potato wedges across the baking sheet. Place in oven. After 25 minutes, flip the wedges, and bake for another 20 minutes.
4. Place into bowl and serve! 

_Alternatively, to reduce cook time_
1. Follow step 1 from above, but while preheating place the wedges in the microwave for about 4 minutes, then stir, then another 4 minutes.
2. Follow step 2 and 3, but instead cook for 10 minutes, then flip. Then bake for an additional 10 minutes.
3. Follow step 4, it's an important one!

### Closing
This is a really simple recipe. I had a bowl of little potatoes that I was able to cut into quartered wedges. You could use larger potatoes, just cut into more wedges from a given potato.

This is definitely another one of those I will be baking again. The seasoning is just so flavourful that I did not even need to use any additional condiments!

Use this as a side for a plethora of dishes. For this first time I had on the side with seasoned beans (pepper with a little garlic powder) and <a href="/food/2018/04/01/lemon-brussels-sprouts-and-carrots.html" target="_blank">Lemon Brussels Sprouts and Carrots</a>.

Added an alternative steps, also added, "Cottage Fries," images. The family restaurant when I was a kid, served Cottage Fries instead of "French Fries." You just need the right tool to slice them, which ia a ridged blade. They turned out beautifully!
