### Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3 apples (peeled and diced)
* 1/4-1/2 tablespoon cinnamon

### Instructions
1. In a small pot, heat oil on medium high. When warm add apples and cinnamon. Cook for about 20 minutes, stirring and as moisture evaporates reduce heat, to prevent burning.
2. Serve warm, or chilled.

### Closing
I made some French toast, but I did not want to put syrup on it. I have so many apples, that I just felt like cooking some up. Despite no sugar added, using honeycrisp apples worked really well. These were quite sweet. I have some Northern Spy (the best apple in whole world, mind you!), that I would like to try, next.

Either way, these are good.
