### Gregory A. Owen

  <img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/963bc50412184b39acc8ad5337864560?s=200" alt="Gregory A. Owen" /> I am a software developer, currently coding for Trek Bicycle Corporation.
  
  I have been working on a few side projects, that I am really excited about. I am feeling the time is coming to the opportunity for me to share them.
  
  In addition, I enjoy designing and playing games (board or electronic), and creating home cooked meals that are generally vegetarian.
